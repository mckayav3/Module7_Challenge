# Module7_Challenge: Web Application for an ETF Analyzer


This application utilizes SQL, Python and Voila to analyze a fintech ETF. The web application will give the daily returns of the ETF stocks individually and as a whole portfolio. The information that we gain from the analysis is then displayed through data visualizations using hvplot.

## Technologies

This was run on a pc using Windows 10

This project leverages python 3.8.8 with the following packages:


* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs) - For manipulating the DataFrame.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io.en/stable) - For code and visualizations.

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - For creating the visualization of our data from the DataFrame.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - For scientific computing with python.

* [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/) - For working with our ETF database
